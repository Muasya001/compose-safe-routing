# Configure SafeRoute
If you want to customize and/or adjust the way SafeRoute works you can do so by passing arguments to the processor.

## Default Package name
Some files, such as `MainGraph`, generated by SafeRoute are generated without specific relation to the package name. Their package name is based on the first element the processor encounters, which is not always ideal and can lead to unintended behaviour
To fix this, you can specify the `defaultPackageName` where files like these will be placed
```kotlin
kapt {
    arguments {
        arg("safeRoute.defaultPackageName", "cz.levinzonr.saferoute.navigation")
    }
}

ksp {
    arg("safeRoute.defaultPackageName", "cz.levinzonr.saferoute.navigation")
}
```
